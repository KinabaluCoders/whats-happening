# Bootstrap-integrated Dynamic Time-line

Under development.

Developer Hints:
* Avoid using CDN links to ease offline development.
* The development code now supports external feed loading.
  In the event that a network connection is unavailable, you
  can still use the random event generator in 
  `development/timeline.debug.js`

TODO:
* Extensive refactoring of feed loading code to 
  introduce/increase modularity and portability.
* Visual styling
* Add available feeds - help out on the 
  [wiki](https://github.com/KinabaluCoders/kinabalucoders.github.io/wiki/News-&-Event-Sources)!
